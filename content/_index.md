        I leverage massively parallel computing techniques via GPGPU programming, graph processing, efficient large-scale collision detection and handling algorithms, and reduced subspace simulation methods to design and implement high-performance non-linear dynamics solvers.

        At present, my research is focused on methods for real-time convergent elastodynamics, robust geometry processing algorithms for cutting in virtual surgery simulations, and reduced physics primitives for solving PDEs on resource-constrained computational platforms.

        Many researchers have a significantly higher bandwidth for designing algorithms than for implementing them. I try to leverage a strong foundation in software engineering to facilitate research velocity via contributions to open-source.
